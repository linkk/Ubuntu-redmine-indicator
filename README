Welcome

I will show to how to test this ubuntu indicator.

First you need to have pyactiveresource module installed on your system.
You can download it from https://github.com/ekarulf/pyactiveresource

Than you should to install it:
1. python3 setup.py sdist
2. python3 setup.py install

After that download Ubuntu-redmine-indicator. To test indicator you have to change in pyredmine.py 
HOST, USER, PASSWORD, and change issue number (199 line in pyredmine.py).

Than Simply type python pyredmine.py.

If you can't see indicator icon that is becouse this line of code is not configured: 
206   ind.set_icon_theme_path("/home/jasmin/workspaceAptana/RedmineIndicator")
